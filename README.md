# conclusion
Movie recommendation systems are an application of machine learning that aims to predict a userâ€™s movie preferences based on their past choices and behavior. These systems use various algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. There are two main types of recommendation systems: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering recommends movies similar to the ones the user has already watched, while collaborative filtering recommends movies based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes
